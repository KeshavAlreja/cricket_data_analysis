Project Overview
Welcome to my Cricket Data Analysis project repository! This project showcases my passion for both cricket and data analysis. Using SQL, I analyzed a comprehensive dataset containing information on international cricket matches, players, and performances. The goal was to gain valuable insights and reveal exciting patterns from the world of cricket.

Project Structure
Data: I've imported nine tables into SQL Server, namely odi_batting, odi_bowling, odi_fielding, t20_batting, t20_bowling, t20_fielding, test_batting, test_bowling, and test_fielding. These tables form the backbone of the project.

Cleaning Process: To ensure accurate analysis, I devoted considerable time to clean and preprocess the dataset. I handled missing values, standardized formats, and resolved inconsistencies.

SQL Queries: I've used a variety of SQL commands such as SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY to extract valuable information. The queries focus on key questions such as 
Who scored the most runs after 2010.
Which bowler has the maximum dismissals in international cricket.
Identifying players with an average above 40 in all formats.
Which batsmen has best 50 to 100 conversion rate in test cricket.
Which batsmen has scored atleast 35 centuries accross formats.
Which players have taken atleast 150 wickets and scored atleast 5000 runs in odi cricket.
Which bowlers have max no. of 10 wicket haul in test cricket.
